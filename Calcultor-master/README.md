## Summary
Freshman year, I started to learn Android development, my first Android application is a calculator, start with just a few buttons on the "patchwork" has become a calculator, click on the "plus" and "minus" "take", "except" button to record the TextView in number as the left operand and empty TextView, recording click on the "equals" button under TextView in numbers as a result of the right operand and the calculated display to TextView, this is my first production. When sophomore, we learn the data structure, so after that I use the stack to improve this application so that it can polynomial computational complexity, but when I use IDE is Eclipse, this is my second time making calculators. Later, when I moved to Android Studio, I made a calculator once again, but I once down the computer, reinstall the system accidentally lost items. So now we have seen today is my second project using the Eclipse production calculator.
